    <h1>Garlic Butter Burger</h1>

        If you’re a fan of garlic bread and Butter Burgers, try out this delicious recipe which is a mashup of the two.
        The burgers themselves have garlic butter inside which melts as the burger cooks, soaking through the meat and
        keeping it super moist.
    </h3>
    <h2>The Garlic-Parsley Compound Butter</h2>
    <p>
        By cooking the garlic gently in some butter first, it softens that harsh, raw garlic flavour whilst infusing the
        butter with the caramelised aromas. This is cooled before being stirred into softened butter and parsley, which
        adds some vibrancy and freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to set some of this aside now so that it remains the perfect consistency for spreading onto the buns.
        However, if you’re prepping this ahead of time, just keep it in the fridge until an hour before you’re ready to
        use it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The remaining garlic-parsley butter is wrapped up in baking paper or wax paper into a log and frozen until firm
        (butter hardens up quickly in the freezer so don’t worry about having to wait ages). I do this because the
        frozen butter is super easy to slice thinly into disks, which can then be wrapped in the burger meat.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salted butter, softened, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 pound 80% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>4 brioche burger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices tomato</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Crush garlic and then cook it in 2 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes.
            This is just to remove the raw flavor of the garlic. </li>
        <li>Let cool, then mix it into the remaining butter with parsley.</li>
        <li>Set half of garlic butter aside to use for spreading on the buns. Wrap remaining butter in a sheet of wax
            paper, roll it into a log (about 1 1/4- inch diameter), then place into the freezer to harden completely,
            about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Unwrap frozen butter, and slice into at least 8 thin disks. It’s better to have more than 8 slices if you
            can to have a few spares. Return 4 slices to the freezer to stay firm.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to a medium-high heat, about 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), then shape the burgers.
            Divide beef into 4 3-ounce pieces and 4 1-ounce pieces. Form the 3-ounce hunks into a patty with a well in
            the center to help contain the butter. Place a frozen disk of garlic butter on top of each of the 4 patties.
        </li>
        <li>Use the 1-ounce pieces of beef to cover the butter disks, pressing beef together firmly to seal butter
            inside. Season both sides of each patty with a pinch of salt and black pepper, then press your thumb into
            the middle of each burger to create a little dip on top.</li>
        <li>Grill burgers for 3 to 4 minutes on one side then flip over. Top each with a disk of garlic butter and, once
            melted, top with a slice of American cheese. Let them cook for 3 to 4 minutes on this side, then remove from
            the grill to a clean tray to rest.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, spread softened garlic butter you set aside earlier over the cut sides of burger buns.</li>
        <li>Grill buns, cut side down, until lightly toasted, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stack burgers into grilled buns with lettuce and tomato and any other bits you want. Serve burgers warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
